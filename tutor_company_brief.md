# Tutor Company Brief (based off Gym brief)

A tutor company has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage students, and register members for extra lessons/tutor sessions.

## MVP
- The app should allow the tutor company to create and edit Students.
- The app should allow the tutor company to create and edit Lessons/tutor sessions.
- The app should allow the tutor company to book students into specific lessons.
- The app should show a list of all upcoming lessons.
- The app should show all students that are booked in for a particular tutor session / extra lesson.

## Possible Extensions
Lessons could have a maximum capacity, and students can only be added while there is space remaining.
The tutor company could mark students and classes as active/deactivated. Deactivated students/lessons will not appear when creating bookings.

## Possible extension from original Gym brief:
The gym could be able to give its members Premium or Standard membership. Standard members can only be signed up for classes during off-peak hours.

## Alternative possibilities that fits better:
The tutor company could offer two types of learning - in person or online. Online students can only book online lessons.
The tutor company could monitor student’s performance / attendance with comments on a student’s profile.
